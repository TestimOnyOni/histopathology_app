# backend/preprocessing.py
"""
Robust preprocessing utilities.

Main function:
    handle_uploaded_file(uploaded_file, return_tensors=False, transform=None)

Supports:
- uploaded_file as: str/pathlib.Path, bytes, file-like object (with read()), or an upload object (has .name, .read()).
- zip files (reads images inside the zip).
- safe extraction helper if you need to extract to disk.

By default returns a list of PIL.Image.Image objects.
Set return_tensors=True to get torch.Tensor objects (requires torchvision).
Optionally pass a torchvision transform via `transform` (applied after ToTensor).
